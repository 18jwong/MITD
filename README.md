Musical Instrument Tower Defense

This is a personal project of mine that is currently ongoing. For now, I'm calling it Defenstruments and it's a "Plants vs. Zombies" inspired tower defense game. Towers are instruments that "shoot" music notes at the enemies which are musical rests. I've composed all the music and created all the art myself.

The repository also contains a tutorial project that I followed from the YouTuber Brackeys.

The game can be played by launching Defenstruments.exe under Builds/Alpha Build 1.0.
